  <h1> HTML은 무엇인가? </h1>

  <p>
  There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Sniper" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">definitions</a> of translation but the one I like is “Translation is the art of expressing an author’s intended meaning in another language in which they are not fluent”.

  The key point here is that the words the translator uses do not have to be identical in both the source and target language, it is the meaning which is the crucial element. Even more importantly for this discussion, the sounds of the words are usually entirely different.

  For example the word ‘hello’ in English sounds completely different to the French translation of the equivalent greeting, “Bonjour”.
